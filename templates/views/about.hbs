        <p class="bio">Hello,<br>
        I am Jiang Gina, a computer engineer who got her M.S degree at "Politecnico di Torino". <br><br>
        I like Math and, as a matter of fact, I won a Honorable Mention at National Mathematics Olympiad (Italy) in 2012.
        Sometime i also reply to some (basic) mathematical question on <a href="https://www.quora.com"> Quora </a> in order to not forget some theoretical concept.<br><br>
        Beside my love for Math, i ended up doing code for job. <br> I am also interested in technology and software <br>
        I see that technolgy evolves very fast and every year there is a new feature. Given this, I knew that i would never get bored since there will be new challenges every now and then.
        Moreover I find more exciting and more stimulating the idea of giving a contribution to society as, nowadays, almost everything relies on technology.
